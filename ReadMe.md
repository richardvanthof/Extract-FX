# RS Extract-fx
## What is it for?

*RS Extract-fx* is a Premiere Pro plugin that automates backing up and restoring video effects to a separate file or adjustment layers. This is especially useful when effect data is misinterpreted while doing a roundtrip to another program like Davinci Resolve. - built using the [Bolt CEP starter](https://hyperbrew.co/resources/bolt-cep/). 

## What effects are supported?

- `Motion`-effects (position, scale, rotation etc.)
- Other video effects from the `effects`-panel.

> While supported, it is recommended to exclude Warp Stabilizer and Lumetri Color.

---

## Config

Update your CEP build and package settings in `cep.config.ts` safely typed

Start building your app in `src/js/main/index(.tsx or .vue or .svelte)`

Write ExtendScript code in `src/jsx/main.ts`

---

## CEP Panel Structure

Each panel is treated as it's own page, with shared code for efficiency. The Boilerplate currently comes with 2 panels, `main` and `settings`. These are configured in the `cep.config.ts`.

Each panel can be edited in their respective folders:

```
src
 └─ js
    ├─ main
    │   ├─ index.html
    |   └─ index.tsx
    └─ settings
        ├─ index.html
        └─ index.tsx
```

To add panels, add an item to the panels object in `cep.config.ts`, and duplicate the folder structure and adjust as needed.

---

## ExtendScript

ExtendScript can be written in ES6 and will be compiled down to a single ES3 file for compatibility.

JSON 2 is included by default, and any external JS libraries added with the include directive will be bundled as well:

```js
// @include './lib/library.js'
```

App-specific code is split into modules for type-safe development by the application's name as seen in the `index.ts`.

```
aftereffects >> aeft/aeft.ts
illustrator >> ilst/ilst.ts
animate >> anim/anim.ts
```

Write your app-specific functions in each of these separate modules, and they will be required per each application.

To add support for additional host apps:

- Add additional app module files (aeft.ts, anim.ts, etc).
- Extend the main `switch()` in `scr/jsx/index.ts` with your additional.
- Add the host to your `cep.config.ts` file.

## Calling ExtendScript from CEP JavaScript

All ExtendScript function are appended to your panel's namespace in the background to avoid namespace clashes when using `evalTS()` and `evalES()`.

We have now introduced a new and improved end-to-end type-safe way to interact with ExtendScript from CEP using `evalTS()`. This function dynamically infers types from
ExtendScript functions and handles both stringifying and parsing of the results so your developer interaction can be as simple as possible.

As demonstrated in `main.tsx`, your ExtendScript functions can be called with `evalTS()` by passing the name of the function, followed by the arguments.

CEP

```js
evalTS("myFunc", "test").then((res) => {
  console.log(res);
});

evalTS("myFuncObj", { height: 90, width: 100 }).then((res) => {
  console.log(res.x);
  console.log(res.y);
});
```

ExtendScript

```js
export const myFunc = (str: string) => {
  return str;
};

export const myFuncObj = (obj: { height: number, width: number }) => {
  return {
    y: obj.height,
    x: obj.width,
  };
};
```

For any existing Bolt CEP projects, rest assured that the legacy `evalES()` function remains in place as usual as demonstrated in `main.tsx`.

```js
evalES(`helloWorld("${csi.getApplicationID()}")`);
```

You will also want to use this function for calling ExtendScript functions in the global scope directly, by passing `true` to the second parameter:

```js
evalES(
  `alert("Hello from ExtendScript :: " + app.appName + " " + app.version)`,
  true
);
```

## Calling CEP JavaScript from ExtendScript

For certain situations such as hooking into event listeners or sending updates during long functions, it makes sense to trigger events from the ExtendScript environment to the JavaScript environment. This can be done with `listenTS()` and `dispatchTS()`.

Using this method accounts for:

- Setting up a scoped listener on the JS side for the CSEvent
- Setting up PlugPlug CSEvent event on ExtendScript side
- Ensuring End-to-End Type-Safety for the event

### 1. Declare the Event Type in EventTS in shared/universals.ts

```js
export type EventTS = {
  myCustomEvent: {
    oneValue: string,
    anotherValue: number,
  },
  // [... other events]
};
```

### 2. Listen in CEP JavaScript

```js
import { listenTS } from "../lib/utils/bolt";

listenTS("myCustomEvent", (data) => {
  console.log("oneValue is", data.oneValue);
  console.log("anotherValue is", data.anotherValue);
});
```

### 3. Dispatch in ExtendScript

```js
import { dispatchTS } from "../utils/utils";

dispatchTS("myCustomEvent", { oneValue: "name", anotherValue: 20 });
```

Alternatively, `dispatchTS()` can also be used in the same way from the CEP side to trigger events within or between CEP panels, just ensure you're importing the dispatchTS() function from the correct file within the `js` folder.

```js
import { dispatchTS } from "../lib/utils/bolt";

dispatchTS("myCustomEvent", { oneValue: "name", anotherValue: 20 });
```

## GitHub Actions ZXP Releases

This repo comes with a configured GitHub Action workflow to build a ZXP and add to the releases each time a git tag is added.

```
git tag 1.0.0
git push origin --tags
```

Then your new build will be available under GitHub Releases.

---

## Copy Assets

If you have assets that you would like copied without being affected by the bundler, you can add the optional `copyAssets:[]` array inside your cep.config.ts to include files or entire folders.

```js
  copyAssets: ["public", "custom/my.jsx"],
```

**Example:**

Files placed in `src/public` will be copied to `dist/public` with config set to `copyAssets: ["public"]`.

---

## Copy Zip Assets

If you have assets that you would like copied with your zxp into a zip archive for delivery, you can add the optional `copyZipAssets:[]` array inside your cep.config.ts to include files or entire folders. A folder ending in "/\*" will copy the contents without the folder structure into the zip destination.

```js
  copyZipAssets: ["instructions/*", "icons"],
```

---

## Custom Ponyfills

Unlike Polyfills which modify the global prototype, Ponyfills replace functionality with custom methods. Built-in Ponyfills include:

- Object.freeze()
- Array.isArray()

You can add your own Ponyfils by passing them into the `jsxPonyfill()` function in `vite.es.config.ts`:

```js
jsxPonyfill([
  {
    find: "Array.isArray",
    replace: "__isArray",
    inject: `function __isArray(arr) { try { return arr instanceof Array; } catch (e) { return false; } };`,
  },
]);
```

If you have a common Ponyfill you feel should be built-in, create a ticket and we'll look into it.

---

## ExtendScript Scope

This boilerplate is flavored for a single JSX object attached to helper object `$` for all your panels to prevent pollution in the global namespace. If you prefer to include your own raw JSX, include it in the Copy Assets object (above), and add the optional scriptPath object to your cep.config.ts file.

```js
  panels: [
    {
      name: "main",
      scriptPath: "custom/index.jsx",
      [...]
    },
    {
      name: "settings",
      scriptPath: "custom/settings.jsx",
      [...]
    },
  ],
  copyAssets: ["custom"],
```

---

## Troubleshooting Modules

Node.js Built-in modules can be imported from the `src/js/lib/node.ts` file.

```js
import { os, path, fs } from "../lib/node";
```

To use 3rd party libraries, first attempt to use with the standard import syntax.

```js
import { FaBolt } from "react-icons/fa";
```

If the import syntax fails (typically with modules that use the Node.js runtime) you can resort to the Node.js `require()` syntax,

```js
const unzipper = require("unzipper");
```

The build system will detect any non-built-in Node.js modules using `require()` and copy them to the output `node_modules` folder, but if a package is missed, you can add it explicitly to the `installModules:[]` array inside your `cep.config.ts` file.

```js
  installModules: ["unzipper"],
```

Also if they're Node.js-specific modules, it's best to place the requires inside functions so they are only required at runtime and don't break your panel when previewing in the browser.

## A Note on Routers

If you would like to set up a routing system like react-router, be aware that you'll have to make adjustments for CEP. React Router for instance bases the router path off of `window.location.pathname` which in the browser resolves to the page:

`/main/index.html`

yet in CEP context resolves to the full system path:

`file:///C:/Users/Username/AppData/Roaming/Adobe/CEP/extensions/com.bolt.cep/main/index.html`

To solve this, you'll need to adjust the router basename for each context, here is one way of accomplishing that with the panel named `main`:

```js
const posix = (str: string) => str.replace(/\\/g, "/");

const cepBasename = window.cep_node
  ? `${posix(window.cep_node.global.__dirname)}/`
  : "/main/";

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Router basename={cepBasename}>[...]</Router>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

## Misc Troubleshooting

**React Spectrum won't allow certain UI items to be clicked on MacOS**:

There is an ongoing bug with React Spectrum and other UI libraries on MacOS with clicking elements. To resolve this issue, run the helper function `enableSpectrum()` to resolve this issue on Mac.

`main.ts`

```js
import { initBolt, enableSpectrum } from "../lib/utils/bolt";

enableSpectrum();
initBolt();
```

**ZXPSignCmd Permissions issues on Mac**:

If you're getting permissions errors running ZXPSignCmd on the latest Mac releases, try a fresh clone. If that does't work, reset permissions for ZXPSignCmd by opening the directory `node_modules/vite-cep-plugin/lib/bin` and running `chmod 700 ./ZXPSignCmd`.

**Build Issues on Mac Arm64 Apple Silicon Machines (M1/M2/M3)**

Full blog post on [Setup ExtendScript Dev for Apple Silicon Macs](https://hyperbrew.co/blog/setup-extendscript-dev-for-apple-silicon/)

Short summary:

If you're experiencing issues building on your Apple Silicon Machine regarding the jsxbin package, it is a known issue since the jsxbin package does not currently contain a binary for Apple Silicon since Adobe has yet to release one ([issue details here](https://github.com/runegan/jsxbin/issues/29)). To solve this issue, you can either:

- **A: Disable JSXBIN**
  - In the `cep.config.ts` set `jsxBin: "off"` in the build and zxp portions.
- **B: Run in x64 mode**
  - Ensure a universal binary version of Node.js is installed (available on [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download))
  - Run your terminal in Rosetta mode, or additionally install the Intel build of VS Code.
  - Delete and re-install your node_modules folder if you've already built it.

**Update a Bolt CEP Project** To update an existing Bolt CEP project to the the latest version, create a new Bolt CEP project with the same framework (React, Vue, Svelte), then compare and update the following files:

1. `package.json` - Update all dependencies and scripts ( `vite-cep-plugin` - usually contains the most frequent updates )
2. `vite.config.ts` - Unless you've modified the vite config yourself, you can just copy the contents of the latest into yours.
3. `vite.es.config.ts` - Like the previous config, unless you've modified it yourself, you can just copy the contents of the latest into yours.
4. `cep.config.ts` - Check if any new properties have been added that don't exist in your config.
5. `src/js/lib` - Update this entire folder.
6. `src/jsx/index.ts` - Check if any new properties have been added that don't exist in your config.
7. `src/shared/universals.d.ts` - Check if any new properties have been added that don't exist in your config.
